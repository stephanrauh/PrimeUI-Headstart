PrimeUI-Headstart
=================

This project is the source code belonging to my blog post http://www.beyondjava.net/blog/started-prime-ui-html5-style/.
It shows how to use PrimeUI in a HTML or PHP page. It also includes AngularJS 1.0.7 to make things fancy.

Simply open one of the two index files:
<ul>
<li>index.html is the simple version working in every modern browser. </li>
<li>index.php is the same file as PHP. Basically, it's almost identical - it only shows PrimeUI also works in a PHP context.</li>
</ul
